# Skeleton from Minecraft

Skeleton from Minecraft is a Flutter application that showcases a stylized representation of the iconic skeleton mob from the popular game Minecraft. 
----------------------------------
Skeleton - a hostile creature in the game Minecraft. It is a mob with a bony body and the ability to shoot arrows from a bow. Skeletons pose a threat to the player, especially in the early stages of the game when the player lacks sufficient protection. They can attack the player from a distance by shooting arrows, which can cause serious damage and create problems during world exploration or construction. Encountering a skeleton requires vigilance and a strategic approach from the player to successfully overcome the threat.
